- Not very familiar with website writing, so the content is relatively simple
- And I'm still fixing a bunch of problems...



For the posts:

- I'll upload some markdown files and html files(converted form md files) as my blog posts, which may contain:
  1. Some of my personal feelings
  2. Partial study notes and notes
  3. Some method records and memos
  4. etc.



Contact me:

- You can contact me by email:
  1. asround@qq.com
  2. asroundzsy@outlook.com
- I'm glad if you want to discuss something in my blog.
  - But I can't guarantee that I will remember everything I write
  - Another but, I'll reply the email as soon as possible :)





Ps:

- latex formula editing support is now not good to use, I may post that kind things on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/74-33-14-69-84)
